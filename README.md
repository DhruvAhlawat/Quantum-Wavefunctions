# Quantum-Wavefunctions
Modeled the time evolution of Quantum wavefunctions using custom integrator with riemann sums and solving for fourier coeffecients for any initial wavefunction inside a 1D box. Using Matplotlib for graphing the outputs. all the functions are inside a class and hence any number of plots can be made by just instantiating different objects of the class. *Animations and Wavefunction file to be added*
