# Quantum-Wavefunctions
Modeled the time evolution of Quantum wavefunctions using custom integrator with riemann sums and solving for fourier coeffecients for any initial wavefunction inside a 1D box. Using Matplotlib for graphing the outputs. all the functions are inside a class and hence any number of plots can be made by just instantiating different objects of the class. *Animations and Wavefunction file to be added*

I got interested in making this because of a question I found while studying for my quantum mechanics course PYL100 at IITD. The question was pretty straightforward and just asked what would happen to a particle when initially it was in a 1D box of length = 'a' in the ground state, and then the size of the box suddenly changes to size '4a'. We had to then find the probability of it being in a particular stationary state of the new box on measurement. The question itself is easy if you know how to write a wavefunction in a sum of solutions of the '4a' box. But I was interested in how the wavefunction itself would evolve with time in this type of arrangement, and hence I made an animation of it on desmos
